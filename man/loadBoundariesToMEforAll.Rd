\title{Load Boundaries to Molecule Experiment Object}
\usage{
loadBoundariesToMEforAll(me, k = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{me}{A Molecule Experiment (ME) object that needs its boundaries populated based
on the assays mentioned above.}
}
\value{
An enriched Molecule Experiment (ME) object that includes boundary information
for the supported assays.
}
\description{
This function takes a Molecule Experiment (ME) object as input and enriches it
with boundary data from a variety of assays. The currently supported assays are:
\itemize{
\item Sub-sector polygons
\item Sub-concentric polygons
\item Sub-combo polygons
\item Super-concentric polygons
\item Super-combo polygons
}

The function internally processes each assay, extracts respective boundary information,
and updates the original ME object with this new data.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assuming `data_obj` is your Molecule Experiment object
enriched_data_obj <- loadBoundariesToME(data_obj)
}

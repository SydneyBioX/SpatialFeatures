Description: This package uses molecule-level information to extract new cell-level features as an alternative to 
  simply calculating gene counts. By using four categories, sub-sector, super-sector, super-sector and super-concentric
  segmentations of cells, SpatialFeatures then uses entropy as a metric to arrive at a cell-by-gene level feature.

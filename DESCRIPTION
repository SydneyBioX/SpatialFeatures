Description: This package uses molecule-level information to extract new 
  cell-level features as an alternative to simply calculating gene counts. By 
  using four categories, sub-sector, super-sector, super-sector and 
  super-concentric segmentations of cells, SpatialFeatures then uses entropy 
  as a metric to arrive at a cell-by-gene level feature. Overall, this means 
  that we can extract more nuanced information from molecule-resolved spatial
  gene expression for further downstream analysis with SingleCellExperiment.
